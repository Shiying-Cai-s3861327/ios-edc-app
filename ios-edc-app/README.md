## Introduction

Our client is **Mr. Eric Tang**, the owner of **Exclusive Dry Cleaners (EDC)**. He provides laundry services to customers in Canada through the company’s website and mobile applications on both Android and iOS.

Therefore, we will be redesigning the existing iOS application and codebase, adding new features as requested by our client as well as making sure that everything is up to date according to iOS’s Human Interface Guidelines. Our application includes all front-end pages for registration, login, logout, order placement, membership services, shopping cart, promotional offers and account setup functions
